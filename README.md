### Want to get to the end? Just fly up. You enter the end once you fly above Y level 320 in the overworld

### Want to get back to the overworld? Just fly down. You enter the overworld once you fly under Y level -10 in the end

### This feature unlocks after you kill the dragon, but can be toggled on or off manually within the config.
